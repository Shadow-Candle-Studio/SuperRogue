To get the most out of the plugin, we recommend you install the templates found inside the TemplateProjects folder.

To install the templates go to the TemplateProjects folder and either double click the Install_Template_Platformer.bat or, if you want,you can manually unzip and copy the contents to a newly created folder called TP_Pixel2D_Platformer inside your Templates folder for the version of Unreal Engine you have the plugin installed to.
Once installed, just start the Engine normally and create a new project and choose the Pixel 2D template from the list. Wait for it to finish creating and you should have everything loaded.
